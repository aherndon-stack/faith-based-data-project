# Faith-Based Data Project: Praise Playlist Analyzer

This project analyzes a pretend playlist of faith-inspired songs to practice key data skills using Python and pandas.

## What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned playlist data
- Explored song moods and lengths
- Visualized mood counts with a bar chart
- Added a bonus feature to add new songs to the dataset

## Why This Project Matters
I wanted to combine my faith with learning data analysis, making the process meaningful and memorable. This project shows my ability to work with real data and create visual insights.

## Skills Used
- Python programming
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Jupyter/Colab notebook environment

## What’s Next
I’m excited to continue building my data skills with larger datasets and more complex analyses — and to bring my unique faith perspective into my work.
